      "I am currently exploring
      the world of 
      web development,
      with hands-on experience 
      in building 
      responsive websites 
      using HTML, CSS, and 
      JavaScript. 
      I have also worked on small
      personal projects that 
      reflect my 
      interest in creativity, 
      design,
      and interactivity. 
      Alongside coding, I have 
      experience in photo editing,
      mobile technology, and basic 
      hacking concepts.
      As a student of science, 
      I constantly try to 
      blend my knowledge 
      with digital skills,
      aiming to grow as a 
      developer and innovator."
